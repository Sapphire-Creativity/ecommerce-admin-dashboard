## 🌐 API with JSON-Server

Since I'm a frontend developer and I needed to work with endpoints to make my project more meaningful and scalable, I created a JSON-Server to simulate backend data for products, orders, and customers. 
I hosted on Render for persistence.

Provides RESTful endpoints like:

GET    /products
POST   /products
PUT    /products/:id
DELETE /products/:id

LIVE URL

## 🚀 Deployment

  - Frontend deployed with Vercel

  - API (JSON-Server) hosted on Render

Live Demo: 👉 [View Project](https://ecommerce-admin-dashboard-sage-gamma.vercel.app)
