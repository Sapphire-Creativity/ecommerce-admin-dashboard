## 🌐 API with JSON-Server

Since I'm a frontend developer and I needed to work with endpoints to make my project more meaningful and scalable, I created a JSON-Server to simulate backend data for products, orders, and customers. 
I hosted on Render for persistence.

Provides RESTful endpoints like:

  - GET    /products
  - POST   /products
  - PUT    /products/:id
  - DELETE /products/:id

LIVE URL

## 🚀 Deployment

  - Frontend deployed with Vercel

  - API (JSON-Server) hosted on Render

Live Demo: 👉 [View Project](https://ecommerce-admin-dashboard-sage-gamma.vercel.app)

## 📜 NOTE

This project was built with intentionality: not just to show coding skills, but to demonstrate the ability to create a real-world, scalable application.

Planned improvements:
  - Google Authentication
  - Exportable/downloadable customer data
  - Continuous feature iteration

Through this project, I enhanced my skills in:
  - CRUD operations
  - Data fetching and handling
  -  Writing clean, maintainable code
